          RID2Caltopo has a clear boundary: the app and DroneScout Bridge do the
          field work, while r2c-tracker adds incident-wide coordination and
          managed online services.

            A DroneScout Bridge is required for reliable Remote ID
            reception. The RID2Caltopo app records what it receives and can
            publish directly to the team&apos;s CalTopo incident map.

          Pilot-authorized IC video is available on iOS; Android support is in

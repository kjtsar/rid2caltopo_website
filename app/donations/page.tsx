        <p>
          RID2Caltopo began a little over a year ago as a Python script that
          converted drone tracks to GeoJSON for import into <CalTopoLink />. Field needs
          kept pulling it forward, and it has grown into a small ecosystem
          supporting our SAR drone team&apos;s work.

            What started as track conversion now spans Android and iOS field
            apps, DroneScout Bridge reception, <CalTopoLink /> publishing, local and
            pilot-authorized video, incident coordination, flight records, and
            an expanding set of operational tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;ve invested many hundreds of hours in the project. Starting late
            last year, I&apos;ve also spent hundreds of dollars on AI tokens and
            development tools to reach the current level of functionality. I
            plan to continue development aimed at making SAR drone teams more
            capable and productive.
